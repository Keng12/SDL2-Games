# Game-of-Life and Snake

To practice C++, I developed Conway's Game of Life [1] and Snake [2] with C++.

Requires SDL2 and C++17 to compile. SDL2 can be installed on Ubuntu via`sudo apt install libsdl2-dev`.

Run via: `./snake` or `./game-of-life` after compiling. Snake is played with the arrow keys.

Tested with Ubuntu and GCC.
